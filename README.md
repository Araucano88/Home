THe /home page ist the first page of the webste like the landingpage. under /about you can find information about me and my life. You can found information about my school and working background in the parts /education and /experiences. The part /interested_in gives space for my hobbies and things wicht interest me. THe part /contactme ist like my bussines card. On the /links page there is space for further information which I like to link.
